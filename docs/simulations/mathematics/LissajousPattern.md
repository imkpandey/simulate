A Lissajous curve in mathematics, also known as Lissajous Figure or Bowditch curve is the
graphical representation of the following system of parametric equations.</p>

**x = A sin(at + δ)**  
**y = B sin(bt)**

These curves/patterns are highly sensitive to the values of ‘a’ and ‘b’, particularly to the ratio
a:b.  
Lissajous curves can also be generated using an oscilloscope. An octopus circuit can be used
to demonstrate the waveform images on an oscilloscope. Two phase-shifted sinusoid inputs are
applied to the oscilloscope in X-Y mode and the phase relationship between the signals is
presented as a Lissajous figure. For convenience, the values of ‘A’ and ‘B’ are equal and
constant in the app. A beautiful animation of how the pattern is drawn is also available.

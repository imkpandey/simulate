A Fourier series in mathematics is a periodic function which consists of sinusoids with a
harmonic relation, and are then combined with a weighted summation.</p>

<p align="justify">
By tweaking these weights the summation can be made to approximate or sometimes even replicate a function in its
one period/cycle. It is as if an arbitrary function is synthesised using these sinusoidal waves.</p>

<p align="justify">
For a given arbitrary function these are derived through the process called Fourier Analysis. The
App contains the Fourier approximation for couple of periodic function namely Square wave
function and the Sawtooth wave function displayed below with the Fourier Series used:</p>

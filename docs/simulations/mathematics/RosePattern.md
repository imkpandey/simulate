A Rose Pattern in mathematics, also known as Rhodonea Curve is sinusoid plotted as polar
coordinates.
</p>

These curves/patterns can be expressed with the following polar equation:

**r = cos(kθ)**

and as a pair or cartesian parametric equations given by:

**x = cos(kθ) · cos(θ)**
**x = cos(kθ) · sin(θ)**

If k is an integer, the curve will be rose-shaped with  
- 2k petals if k is even, and  
- k petals if k is odd.

In the app, k is calculated with 2 parameters ‘n’ and ‘d’ as:  
 **k = n/d**  
 The simulation also features an offset parameter governed by the following equation:  
 **r = cos(kθ) + c**

!!! tip "Did you know?"
    Rose petals are arranged in a  Fibonacci spiral. This means that petal number one and six will be on the same vertical imaginary line
